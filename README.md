# SEO Homework 01
The first of UConn's Coding Bootcamp assignments exploring SEO utilizing semantic html and CSS.

## Goal:
The goal was to increase the accessibility of an existing website while addressing formatting issues, debugging code and increasing the efficiency and functionality of the site while maintaining the design of the user interface.

## Issues:
- CSS Positioning styles and box models proved challenging and required extra time to research.

- I realized after lots of trial and error that I could have been 'commenting' code out so that I could reference the old code. I also realized that I should have used that to write notes in the documents to clarify the changes I made. In the end I only used it as a way to separate different parts of the .css. 

## Results:

![Finished site after optimization.](./assets/SBG_SEO_Assignment)

The end product doesn't look different as the assignment was to maintain the user interface; however, semantic html has been added as well as alt tags for accessibility. Many classes and id's have been changed in an effort to clarify and simplify the documents for future editing and SEO.

## Summary:
This assignment was challenging and fun. It showed me where the gaps in my knowledge are, as well as increased my confidence in using Git, the Terminal, and the Inspector as developer tools. I have a deeper understanding of CSS and html as well as an appreciation for SEO and a curiosity about how I can improve my html and CSS to write the cleanest code possible.
